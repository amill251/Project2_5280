## Project Purpose

In this assignment we will use Firebase to create a game application:

- The app should provide Authentication and Signup using the Firebase email/password authentication. The user should be able to signup, login and log out.
- You should use Firestore to manage the game data and signaling between the different players.
- The game is the UNO card game for two users. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)  (Links to an external site.)
    - The cards are numbered from 0 to 9, and colored Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue. There are 2 special cards namely, the Skip (One of each color) and Draw 4 (4 cards).
    - At the beginning of the game each user is dealt 7 cards, and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The game rules follow:
        - Play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
        - Play a Wild Draw Four card, which can be played on any color/symbol/number and you will need to select a color.
        - Draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible
    - Each user is only able to see their cards, and the top card on the discard pile. The user is also able to draw 1 card during their turn.
    - The game is played by the two users and ends when a users finishes their cards.
    - The app should clearly indicate who's turn is it to make it easier to visualize the turns.

- App UI:
    - You should design the app UI to enable the usable transition between the screens and make it easy for the user to reach the different app screens. Consider using, a side drawer, or Tab Bar. 

#### Submission should include:
- Start by creating an App mockup/wireframe using a wire-framing tool such as.

   - https://www.justinmind.com/ (Links to an external site.)
   - https://www.invisionapp.com/ (Links to an external site.)
   - https://idoc.mockplus.com/?home=1 (Links to an external site.)
   - https://www.mockplus.com/?r=trista (Links to an external site.)
   - https://marvelapp.com/ (Links to an external site.)
   - https://mockflow.com/ (Links to an external site.)
- The app mockup should be shared online through adobe cloud or other frameworks and should enable the user to walk through the design and interact with components to understand the app flow.
- Create a Github or Bitbucket repo for the assignment.
   - Push your code to the created repo. Should contain all your code.
   - On the same repo create a wiki page describing your design and implementation. The wiki page should describe the data design choices.
- Demo your App and record an app screencast showing the different app features. Your video should be posted on Youtube and a link included in the Github Wiki page. Make sure the YouTube video is public or link only so that it is viewable through the shared link.
